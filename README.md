# Online-Ticket-Booking-System Using Spring Boot

Hey there! Ever dreamt of creating your own online ticket booking system, just like the ones you use for movies or events? Well, you're in for a treat because I'm making it happen, and I'm adding a touch of Spring Boot magic! ðŸŽ‰

Imagine a system where you can easily check the latest movies, their showtimes, and book tickets hassle-free. That's what I'm building, and I'm doing it in a super cool and simple way using Spring Boot.

Spring Boot is like my coding sidekick, making it easy for me to connect with other systems (like getting movie info) and storing data efficiently (like user details and booking history).

Whether you're new to coding or a seasoned developer, this project is perfect for you. So, join me on this fun adventure, and let's bring my idea of a ticket booking system to life together! ðŸš€ðŸŽ¬
